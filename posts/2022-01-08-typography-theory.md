# Typography Theory

## Typography in Design

- Typography: art or technique of displaying words or text in a readable, digestible, and appealing way
- Typeface: groups of fonts that share a similar style or characterisitic
- Font: 
  - one style or weight of a typeface
  - collection of glyphs
- Classifications: serif, sans-serif, script, decorative
- Serif: 
  - tails on the end of each letter
  - makes smaller type easier to read (ex. books)
- Sans-serif:
  - without tails at the end of each letter
  - great headlines; simple and clean appearance, don't compete with other design elements like a serif font would
- Script:
  - curve and unique stroke-weights
  - handwritten
  - demand attention
  - can be hard to read for non-primary language readers
  - hand lettering: custom version of a script font written out
- Decorative: 
  - can feel like graphics instead of types
  - grunge is a popular variant
  - so detailed, they can stand alone as statement

## Type Anatomy

- character: each letter of a word
- baseline: horizontal line that hugs the bottom and top of each letter, doesn't include tails
- descenders: tails below the bottom baseline
- ascenders: tails above the top baseline
- x-height: the height between the baselines
- ascent line: horizontal line at the top of your ascenders
- descent line: horizontal line at the bottom of your descenders
- not all fonts follow this pattern (ex. script fonts)
- tail: tip of the character
- ascender area: space between the top baseline and the ascent line
- descender area: space between the bottom baseline and the descent line
- stem: straight portions of a character | (ex. sides of the A)
- ears: anything that expands outside of the character
- shoulder: the hoop in an "h"
- loops: g
- closed counter: anything closed inside a character; a p o
- leg: diagonal line of K
- crossbars: join two stems together (ex. joining section of the A)

### Must-Know Terms

- Kerning: the space between each character
- Leading: the spaces between sentences or phrases
  - larger spacing looks clean
  - tighter spacing can look cramped
- design with different font types in the same headline
  - ex. take less important words, make them smaller and italics
