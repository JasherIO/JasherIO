# Typography Theory

## Typography in Design

- Typography: art or technique of displaying words or text in a readable, digestible, and appealing way
- Typeface: groups of fonts that share a similar style or characterisitic
- Font: 
  - one style or weight of a typeface
  - collection of glyphs
- Classifications: serif, sans-serif, script, decorative
- serif: 
  - tails on the end of each letter
  - makes smaller type easier to read (ex. books)
- sans-serif:
  - without tails at the end of each letter
  - great headlines; simple and clean appearance, don't compete with other design elements like a serif font would
- script:
  - curve and unique stroke-weights
  - handwritten
  - demand attention
  - can be hard to read for non-primary language readers
  - hand lettering: custom version of a script font written out
- decorative: 
  - can feel like graphics instead of types
  - grunge is a popular variant
  - so detailed, they can stand alone as statement
