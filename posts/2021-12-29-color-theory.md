# Color Theory

## Wavelengths

- colors are wavelengths defined by frequency
- wavelengths can be absorbed or reflected by objects
- ex. an apple aborbs every wavelength but red; it refelts red back to us, which we perceive
- white: reflects all wavelengths
- black: absorbs all wavelengths

## Properties

### Hue (Color)

- the reflected lightwave we name
- in design and print, a hue is described as a color with no values added to it (no other black or grays added to it)
- HSV (hue saturation value) / HSB (hue saturation brightness)
- HSL (hue saturation lightness)

### Saturation

- intensity of color
- dull vs vibrant
- more saturated -> more intense

### Value

- lightness and darkness of a color
- tint: adding white to a color
- shade: adding black to a color
- tone: adding gray to a color
- brightness: how much light an object is emitting

### Tonal Range

- the range of grays from black to white

### Lightness

- how light or dark an object is compared to other like objects

### Contrast

- the differences in hues, saturations, and values
- high contrast helps elements stand out
- low contrast helps an element blend in
- trick: turn your art into grayscale; if text is illegible, then the contrast is not high enough

## Color Mixing and Systems

### RGB (red green blue) 

- displays
- Good for objects that use light
- Additive color: colors combine to complete the full color spectrum

### CYMK (cyan magenta yellow key)

- printing
- Subtractive color: colors are absorbed into the object or substrate
- Key: black pigment

## Color for Digital and Print Media

### Pixel density

- Pixels per inch (PPI); display
- Pixels per cm (PPC); display
- Dots (of pigment) per inch (DPI); print
- Bit depth: the amount of colors that can be stored in a channel (ex. red, blue, green in RGB)
  - 1 bit = 2 colors
  - 2 bits = 4 colors
  - 3 bits = 8 colors
  - 4 bits = 16 colors
  - ...
  - 8 bits = 256 colors (web design)
  - 16 bits = 65,536 colors (print)
  - 32 bits = 16,777,215 colors (big prints; large file sizes)

## Color Selections and Methods

- Color Picker: extract color information from individual pixels
- [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com)
- Color Pallete: an assortment of color swatches
- Duotone: multi-tone prints with individual color channels
- Gradient: a blend of different colors and/or patterns

## Color Harmonies and Meanings

- We associate colors with feelings
  - red: energy, alertness, love
  - orange: excitement, art, food
  - yellow: happiness, stimulation, attention
  - green: health, calmness, earth
  - blue: trust, loyalty, security
  - purple: wealth, pride, luxury
  - brown: reliablity, honesty, natural
  - gray: neutrality, communication, composure
  - black: power, discipline, elegance
  - white: purity, cleanliness, light
- warm: red, orange, yellow
- cool: green, blue, purple

### Harmonies

- Monochromatic: different tints and shades of a single color
- Analagous: different hues close to the main color on the color wheel
  - more variety than monochromatic
  - common to warm and cool color palletes
- Complementary: colors 180 degrees from the source color
- Triad: three colors evenly spaced across the color wheel

## Create a Mood Board with Canva

- [Canva: Color Palette Generator](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/)
- Take color inspiration from related scenes/objects (ex. if designing something for a grocery store, take inspiration from the colors of greens and other foods)
- [Canva: Design Size Guide](https://www.canva.com/sizes/)
