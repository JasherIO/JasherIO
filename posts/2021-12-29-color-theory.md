# Color Theory

## Wavelengths

- colors are wavelengths defined by frequency
- wavelengths can be absorbed or reflected by objects
- ex. an apple aborbs every wavelength but red; it refelts red back to us, which we perceive
- white: reflects all wavelengths
- black: absorbs all wavelengths

## Properties

### Hue (Color)

- the reflected lightwave we name
- in design and print, a hue is described as a color with no values added to it (no other black or grays added to it)
- HSV (hue saturation value) / HSB (hue saturation brightness)
- HSL (hue saturation lightness)

### Saturation

- intensity of color
- dull vs vibrant
- more saturated -> more intense

### Value

- lightness and darkness of a color
- tint: adding white to a color
- shade: adding black to a color
- tone: adding gray to a color
- brightness: how much light an object is emitting

### Tonal Range

- the range of grays from black to white

### Lightness

- how light or dark an object is compared to other like objects

### Contrast

- the differences in hues, saturations, and values
- high contrast helps elements stand out
- low contrast helps an element blend in
- trick: turn your art into grayscale; if text is illegible, then the contrast is not high enough

## Color Mixing and Systems

### RGB (red green blue) 

- displays
- Good for objects that use light
- Additive color: colors combine to complete the full color spectrum

### CYMK (cyan magenta yellow key)

- printing
- Subtractive color: colors are absorbed into the object or substrate
- Key: black pigment

## Color for Digital and Print Media

### Pixel density

- Pixels per inch (PPI); display
- Pixels per cm (PPC); display
- Dots (of pigment) per inch (DPI); print
- Bit depth: the amount of colors that can be stored in a channel (ex. red, blue, green in RGB)
  - 1 bit = 2 colors
  - 2 bits = 4 colors
  - 3 bits = 8 colors
  - 4 bits = 16 colors
  - ...
  - 8 bits = 256 colors (web design)
  - 16 bits = 65,536 colors (print)
  - 32 bits = 16,777,215 colors (big prints; large file sizes)

## Color Selections and Methods

- Color Picker: extract color information from individual pixels
- [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com)
- Color Pallete: an assortment of color swatches
- Duotone: multi-tone prints with individual color channels
- Gradient: a blend of different colors and/or patterns
