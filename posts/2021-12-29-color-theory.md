# Color Theory

## Wavelengths

- colors are wavelengths defined by frequency
- wavelengths can be absorbed or reflected by objects
- ex. an apple aborbs every wavelength but red; it refelts red back to us, which we perceive
- white: reflects all wavelengths
- black: absorbs all wavelengths

## Properties

### Hue (Color)

- the reflected lightwave we name
- in design and print, a hue is described as a color with no values added to it (no other black or grays added to it)
- HSV (hue saturation value) / HSB (hue saturation brightness)
- HSL (hue saturation lightness)

### Saturation

- intensity of color
- dull vs vibrant
- more saturated -> more intense

### Value

- lightness and darkness of a color
- tint: adding white to a color
- shade: adding black to a color
- tone: adding gray to a color
- brightness: how much light an object is emitting

### Tonal Range

- the range of grays from black to white

### Lightness

- how light or dark an object is compared to other like objects

### Contrast

- the differences in hues, saturations, and values
- high contrast helps elements stand out
- low contrast helps an element blend in
- trick: turn your art into grayscale; if text is illegible, then the contrast is not high enough
